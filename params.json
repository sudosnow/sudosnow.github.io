The challenge is that these devices can be very expensive, kind of finicky and not available for the masses.   \r\n\r\n**Solution**: Our CNC was designed to easily take computer renderings to drive a motion system that can physically cut a component.  \r\n\r\n**Results**\r\nThey key benefit is that I have designed this device so that it could be manufactured for under $200.  \r\n \r\n### IOT Lyrics Engine\r\n\r\n**Problems**: To master the guitar, you have to memorize lyrics, chords and TABS for literally hundreds of songs songs.  The reality is that many people forget these lyrics when they are playing resulting in a very awkward presentation.  \r\n\r\n**Solution**:  Our device streams chords and lyrics from the Internet to a screen that sits at the end of neck of your guitar.  You can quickly download your playlist to the device where it will scroll thru them while you are playing.  Additionally you can set the scroll speed and play the music in real time.   You’ll never forget how to play a song again.  I have submitted this design to a patent company for review.\r\n \r\n### IOT Soils Management\r\n\r\n**Problem**: Growing healthy plants is an art form that requires a sophisticated understanding of soil nutrients, moisture content and light penetration.  Generally when you buy a plant you pour water on it and pray it grows.  \r\n\r\n**Solution**: Our application is a IOT spike that you stick into to the soil and it feeds back information on nutrients, soil and light back to a mobile application.  The next phase of this project is to create a drip device that distributes water and nutrients to the plant based on the measurements generated by the sensor.\r\n \r\n### Interactive Robot\r\n\r\n**Problem**: One of the revolutions in robotics is the ability to translate human motion into robotic motor control.  This ability allows us to monitor physical motions in an environment and either mimic or augment that motion via robotic actions.   \r\n\r\n**Solution**:   Our device is a platform that identifies gestures and creates corresponding electronic motor movements.  The next phase of this project will translate these gestures into robotic arm movements that can be used to remotely manipulate environments where humans cannot function.  Like underwater environments or locations that have contaminated by toxic materials.\r\n \r\n### Robot lock picker\r\n \r\n**Problem**: Legally picking lock can be a fun past time.  The revered physicist Richard Feynman spent much of his time while developing the atomic bomb at Los Alamos practicing his safe cracking skills.   The pins of a physical lock give off a sound pattern when they are activated.  \r\n\r\n**Solution**: Our device listens to these sound patterns and assists the lock picker in activating the proper sequence.    It does take some of the fun out picking locks, but has proven to be a great application of translating sound pattern recognition to map that lets you pick a lock.\r\n \r\n### Navigation For The Visually Impaired \r\n\r\n**Problem**: For people that rely on applications like Google Maps and Mapquest, It's hard to imagine navigating without them. Sadly, because we can't yet manipulate mobile displays in three dimensions, the visually impaired have a more difficult time exploring their surroundings. The most common technique to give the visually impaired a mental representation of their physical surroundings is to create with tactile replacements for visual components. Tools do exist to create these maps, but they are expensive, slow, and hard to create.  \r\n\r\n**Solution**: The application I developed, converts images of maps into vectorized laser cut files. After prototyping a user interface with google maps and chrome speech recognition, I proposed it to my two team mates that then built out the web application. \r\nDuring that time I developed new techniques to improve the key qualities of the maps. The three factors I found most important were: how differentiable the paths were through touch, speed of the map produced, and physical form.\r\nThe most successful technique I developed created embossed paths quickly using cut rutines rather than the time intensive and less defined ridges that come with engraving.\r\n \r\n**Results**: Prior to the image processing system and web application, there was no established way for people to go from location or directions on a map to a vectorized format.\r\nUsers simply speak or type the location they're looking for and click download to acquire the file.\r\n\r\nThe cutting techniques that I developed\r\n\r\n- Reduce the material cost of a map by  \r\n\t- 345% compared to plastic 3d printed maps\r\n\t- 820% compared to thermally printed maps\r\n- Reduce the fabrication time (machining time)\r\n\t- 1600% compared to plastic 3d printed maps\r\n\t- 450% compared to thermally printed maps\r\n- Physical Properties\r\n\t- Thermal paper is succeptable to water, heat, rips, rederioration of ridges\r\n\t- 3d prints have very low resolution making it hard to print dense maps as a small object, non flexible materials\r\n\t- There is a wide variety of materials that can be laser cut, materials can be easily acquired, \r\n\r\n \r\n### Ultrasonic Eco Location – \r\n\r\n**Problem**: Interesting fact is that Human beings actually have the ability to navigate by sound.  Many of the vision impaired can use this sonar like ability to visualize distance from objects and physically topology. \r\n\r\n**Solution**:  Our device sends out a high frequency sounds that cannot be heard.  The device then receives those signals back and translates them into sound patterns that help the visually map their environment.  The advantage of using high frequency sound is that the process is completely silent. \r\n \r\n### Cross Platform Message Encryption\r\n\r\n**Problem**: With the proliferation of public WIFI, your communication is often completely visible to anyone interested in monitoring it.  It is downright scary how easy it is to hijack your text and manipulate or track it.  There are encryption plugins for email, but most people are now communicating via text applications like Whatsapp and Snap Chat. \r\n\r\n**Solution**: Our plugin allows the user to easily encrypt data on multiple web applications and send it to another user.  To activate the encryption simply press a browser button and a key is generated, sent to the receiver where it is automatically decrypted.\r\n \r\n### IOT Motion Control\r\n\r\n**Problem**:  \r\n\r\n**Solution**: Our device receives streaming motion data from a server and translates them into motor control.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
