<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Computer controlled cutting devices have been an important invention in the process if creating custom parts.  The challenge is that these devices can be very expensive, you'll likely never be able to use one, and even if you do they're pretty breakable so good luck. Despite their significance in manufacturing, there are no consumer CNC's for under 700$ yet* that you don't need a CNC to build. Another major issue I have with CNCs is that they are ridiculously sized, often way too large taking up an entire room or too small to cut real material like wood.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Having never seen or used a CNC I designed and fabricated, from scratch, a CNC that uses raw materials that can be acquired from Home Depot. The additional components: motor controller, motors, and power supply have to be purchased online bringing the current* grand total to 174.77 USD (Which will vary depending on the Dremmel).
To Solve my complaint about the size, I designed a framing system that can be easily swapped out to resize the cut area. EX: I have a 3'x3' frame right now, but by purchasing new 2'..4'..5' raw metal rods I can change the size to suit my needs.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>They key benefit is that I have designed this device so that it could be manufactured for under $200</li>
<li>The entire machine can be assembled in under 1 minute and 30 seconds</li>
<li>The entire machine can be disassembled in under 1 minute</li>
<li>Disassembled, all of the parts can easily fit into a backpack</li>
<li>Modular design allows for easy replacement of parts</li>
<li>Innovative rail system allows for smaller motors, requiring less torque</li>
<li>Innovative gantry design eliminates need for expensive specialized bearings like linear or V slot</li>
<li>Uses commodity skateboard wheels, and not very many of them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Problems</strong>: To master the guitar, you have to memorize lyrics, chords and TABS for literally hundreds of songs songs.  The reality is that many people forget these lyrics when they are playing resulting in a very awkward presentation.  </p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>:  This device streams chords and lyrics from the Internet to a screen that sits at the end of neck of your guitar.  You can quickly download your playlist to the device where it will scroll thru them while you are playing.  Additionally you can set the scroll speed and play the music in real time.   Youâ€™ll never forget how to play a song again.  I have submitted this design to a patent company for review.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Growing healthy plants is an art form that requires a sophisticated understanding of soil nutrients, moisture content and light penetration.  Generally when you buy a plant you pour water on it and pray it grows.  </p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: This application is a IOT spike that you stick into to the soil and it feeds back information on nutrients, soil and light back to a mobile application.  The second phase of this project was creating a drip device that distributes water and nutrients to the plant based on the measurements generated by the sensor.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: One of the revolutions in robotics is the ability to interact with responsive robots that translate human motion into robotic motion.  This ability allows us to monitor physical motion in an environment and either mimic or augment that motion via robotic actions.   </p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>:   This system identifies gestures and creates corresponding electronic motor movements.  The second  project will translate these gestures into robotic arm movements that can be used to remotely manipulate environments where humans cannot function.  Like underwater environments or locations that have contaminated by toxic materials.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Legally picking lock can be a fun past time.  The revered physicist Richard Feynman spent much of his time while developing the atomic bomb at Los Alamos practicing his safe cracking skills.   The pins of a physical lock give off a sound pattern when they are activated.  </p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: As you pick a lock, this device listens to these sound patterns created by the pins and matches them to the training template of the unique sound emitted by each of the possible pin codes. To do the pattern recognition, I wrote an implementation of Dynamic Time Warping for the Photon IoT board which enabled super fast real time sequence matching from the hardware level. It does take some of the fun out picking locks, but is the first machine I've seen that can simultaneously pick and decode locks.</p>

<p>(Repository)[<a href="https://github.com/PseudoSky/aft-maps">https://github.com/PseudoSky/aft-maps</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: For people that rely on applications like Google Maps and Mapquest, It's hard to imagine navigating without them. Sadly, because we can't yet manipulate mobile displays in three dimensions, the visually impaired have a more difficult time exploring their surroundings. The most common technique to give the visually impaired a mental representation of their physical surroundings is to create with tactile replacements for visual components. Tools do exist to create these maps, but they are expensive, slow, and hard to create.  </p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: The application I developed, converts images of maps into vectorized laser cut files. After prototyping a user interface with google maps and chrome speech recognition, I proposed it to my two team mates that then built out the web application. 
During that time I developed new techniques to improve the key qualities of the maps. The three factors I found most important were: how differentiable the paths were through touch, speed of the map produced, and physical form.
The most successful technique I developed created embossed paths quickly using cut rutines rather than the time intensive and less defined ridges that come with engraving.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: Prior to the image processing system and web application, there was no established way for people to go from location or directions on a map to a vectorized format.
Users simply speak or type the location they're looking for and click download to acquire the file.</p>

<p>The cutting techniques that I developed</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the material cost of a map by<br>

<ul>
<li>345% compared to plastic 3d printed maps</li>
<li>820% compared to thermally printed maps</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduce the fabrication time (machining time)

<ul>
<li>1600% compared to plastic 3d printed maps</li>
<li>450% compared to thermally printed maps</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physical Properties

<ul>
<li>Thermal paper is succeptable to water, heat, rips, rederioration of ridges</li>
<li>3d prints have very low resolution making it hard to print dense maps as a small object, non flexible materials</li>
<li>There is a wide variety of materials that can be laser cut, materials can be easily acquired, </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Interesting fact is that Human beings actually have the ability to navigate by sound.  Many of the vision impaired can use this sonar like ability to visualize distance from objects and physically topology. </p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>:  Our device sends out a high frequency sounds that cannot be heard.  The device then receives those signals back and translates them into sound patterns that help the visually map their environment.  The advantage of using high frequency sound is that the process is completely silent. </p>

<p>(Repo)[<a href="https://github.com/PseudoSky/Psypher">https://github.com/PseudoSky/Psypher</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: With the proliferation of public WIFI, your communication is often completely visible to anyone interested in monitoring it.  It is downright scary how easy it is to hijack your text and manipulate or track it.  There are encryption plugins for email, but most people are now communicating via text applications like Whatsapp and Snap Chat. </p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>: This plugin allows the user to easily encrypt data across multiple web applications (Groupme, Slack, Facebook, Gmail) and send it to another user.  The system handles key storage and exchange as well as automatic decryption of text from inside the app. You'll never see encrypted text, unless you turn the plugin off or delete your key. All you have to do to use it is go to facebook open your chat, type your message, hit "command/ctrl" and "e" and your message will be encrypted in that text box. Once you hit send, because you have your own key, you see the message you were typing.</p>
